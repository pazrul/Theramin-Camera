Welcome to my Theramin project.

My goal is to create a working Theramin using only webkit (until Blink) browsers. I want to have a web camera recognize the distance of a hand from the camera, then use that as the volume or pitch of the theramin. I suppose I could try and set up two hand recognition and try for both, but I think I'm gonna do one at a time.

Todo: Break out html single page into css and js files.
js: Create real init function for oscillator, so I can create a start and stop button.

css: Put a theramin picture up? No design ideas yet.

functionality: Add camera support, then add https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect/ functionality to that.
